# 24 Days In Umbraco Archive

This is the static archive of all the articles from 2012 to 2021,
which are being served on http://archive.24days.in/umbraco-cms/

Originally, this design used fonts from Typekit (Adobe Fonts) but we
decided to selfhost a couple of close(-ish) fonts from Google Fonts
instead, to save the extra bandwidth of going to Adobe's servers.

Any questions regarding these articles or the 24 Days In Umbraco
project in general, can be directed at the `umbraco` email address
on the `24days.in` domain.

Thanks 🙌
