      <h2>Heads Up!</h2>
      <p>
					This article is several years old now, and much has happened since then,
					so please keep that in mind while reading it.

    <div class="content-column">
      <h2>The lost art of talking</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we are babies we are desperate to communicate, this is usually through crying, noises and so forth. This occurs when a baby is as little as one month old, depending on which studies and research you agree with: </span><a href="http://www.parenting.com/article/baby-speech-milestones"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://www.parenting.com/article/baby-speech-milestones</span></a></p>
<p class="intro"><span style="font-weight: 400;">However despite the fact that we now have the power to talk and communicate with more people than ever we as an industry are losing the willingness to talk unless forced to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not the best segue I've ever written, so apologies, so what does prevent us...</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introversion</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Introvert</span></h3>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">A shy, reticent person.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">From </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psychology </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A person predominantly concerned with their own thoughts and feelings rather than with external things.</span></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The above extract is the definition taken from the Oxford English Dictionary Online, and I suspect there are a number of people reading this article who might describe themselves this way </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.16personalities.com/enfj-personality">https://www.16personalities.com/enfj-personality</a> you can find out where you score on tests like these.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With regards to speaking, people often say it's fear of failure and rejection that prevents them from speaking up. This is often as a result of schooling practices and social interactions where failure is seen as bad rather than a good thing)</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how do we change this and why should we.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been to one of the recent Umbraco Festivals you may have seen Niels (chief Unicorn) talk about the mission of Umbraco:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">We help you deliver delightful digital experiences by making Umbraco friendly, simple and social</span></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What this translates into is we need to concentrate on the things our clients and potential customers want and need. </span></p>
<p>Whether it’s a simple interface, or a complex system, it is the moments of delight when you make something easier and that means being able to talk and understand what a client actually wants.</p>
<p>A recent example i saw was an OffroadCode example using the datatype description in a fun and friendly way (thanks to Janae and OffroadCode for letting me use this)</p>
<p><img style="width: 500px; height: 324.58333333333337px;" src="/archive/media/2016/jnae.jpg?width=500&amp;height=324.58333333333337" alt="" rel="1425" data-id="1425"></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how can speaking make me more money</span></h2>
<p>and no I am not talking about the after dinner speech tour though that is very lucrative</p>
<p><img style="width: 400px; height: 275px;" src="/archive/media/2016/money.gif?width=400&amp;height=275" alt="Money money money" rel="1423" data-id="1423"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By talking to customers and understanding (well, trying to work out what they want to do), you will unlock the portal to:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNIVERSE.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, you are more likely to be able to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interpret what a user wants or has a problem with</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to deliver a more tailored solution</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deliver what they need rather than what they say they want because you understand what they are actually trying to do</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you can build better systems, </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">solve issues quicker</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">avoid confusion with specifications.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you will get more work </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stop projects running off the rails because there is a disconnect between the client and the specification of the job (a re-skin is not the same a rebuild (this has happened to me many times))</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">better product design (through better customer understanding). On this last point, it's also worth making sure you don't always discount the dissenting voice. Sometimes what you think is an improvement is not (I'm looking at you SourceTree)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By being able to do this because you can talk to people in meetings (or individually) will make you more valuable. </span>Because time = money and less time wasted is more money earned</p>
<h2>Don't be a Martyr, talk out your problems</h2>
<p><img style="width: 500px; height: 399.8589562764457px;" src="/archive/media/2016/morehnng.jpg?width=500&amp;height=399.8589562764457" alt="More hnng please" rel="1424" data-id="1424"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asking for help can mean many things. It could can mean using an inanimate object, however I like using real people that way you can often get a different perspective and a better route to complete you task </span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.rubberduckdebugging.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://www.rubberduckdebugging.com/</span></a></p>
<p>It's the same process when you talk to someone except the rubber duck won't talk back (if your duck does talk, it's very strange).</p>
<p><img style="width: 284px; height: 300px;" src="/archive/media/2016/duck.gif?width=284&amp;height=300" alt="howard the duck" rel="1426" data-id="1426"></p>
<h2><span>Channels of communicating</span></h2>
<p><span>Obviously talking to people is the most obvious way of communicating, but we have more tools than ever to make contact with people than ever before so make sure you use them</span></p>
<p><span>There are numerous slack channels: </span>umbracians.slackhq.com </p>
<p><span>There is the our.umbraco.org forum </span></p>
<p><span>There are numerous twitter users and you can search for the #umbraco hashtag</span></p>
<p><span>There are various other internet messaging services some are even dedicated to cat pictures alone if you need a quick cheer up:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.emergencykitten.com/"><span>http://www.emergencykitten.com/</span></a></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting better at speaking</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way is to practice - there are any number of books on Amazon or other retailers which can give you advice</span></p>
<p>How to be brilliant at public speaking: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Brilliant-Public-Speaking-Audience/dp/0273755218" title="Brilliant">https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Brilliant-Public-Speaking-Audience/dp/0273755218</a></p>
<p>Talk Like Ted: Speaking Secrets: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Talk-Like-TED-Speaking-Secrets/dp/1447261135" title="talk like Ted">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Talk-Like-TED-Speaking-Secrets/dp/1447261135</a></p>
<h2>Where can I practice?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than diving directly into the world of open mic nights and after-dinner speaking, we have a number of other friendlier options available to us to get this practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find a Local Umbraco meet up and socialise<br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get to know the people, get comfortable. There is no pressure and no expectation and then do a demo or maybe a short talk</span></p>
<p>The Umbraco newsletter has a list of the various and growing number of groups: <a href="http://skrift.io/" title="Skrift - online umbraco magazine">skrift.io</a> has the upcoming festivals and the monthly email does too</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then you can work up to speaking at one of these fine events:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uk Festival <a href="http://umbracofestival.co.uk/" target="_blank" title="UK Fest">http://umbracofestival.co.uk/</a> usually around late October Early November</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">uWestfest <a href="http://www.uwestfest.com/" title="Denver 2017">http://www.uwestfest.com/</a> 2017 Denver</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Duugfest <a href="http://duug.nl/" title="DuugFest">http://duug.nl/</a></span></p>

<h2><span>Hello My Name is Ravi</span><span> </span></h2>
<p><span>I’m an Umbraco web developer, Umbracco community MVP &amp; you may recognise me from running the London Umbraco meetup, or as the person who was dunked fully clothed into a hot tub, worn a giraffe suit and been part of a breadcrumb code challenge where I was electrocuted. When I am not doing my day job, I can normally be found around East London looking for people to speak at meetups.</span></p>
