      <p class="teaser">Let me start with introducing myself. My name is Simon. I'm a self taught designer, frontend developer, <a href="http://onedayout.io/" target="_blank" title="One Day Out Conference">conference</a> organzier and <a href="http://slack.devdk.org" target="_blank" title="Devdk on Slack">community</a> creator. I've spent the last two years at the Umbraco HQ.</p>
<p class="intro">In November 2016, I decided to quit my position at Umbraco. I did it to pursue a dream of building projects that had stacked up in my notebooks over the years.</p>
<h3>Fueling creativity</h3>
<p>Wasn't it for side projects, I probably wouldn't have worked at Umbraco in the first place. Meaning, if I hadn't organized a conference in Odense, I wouldn't have meet Niels.</p>
<p>In my two years at Umbraco, we spent most of our freedom fridays on building side projects. Some you may already use in Umbraco without knowing it, others didn't see the light. </p>
<p>Freedom Fridays was a great way for us to get to play with new technologies, get crazy ideas and built them or bond with colleagues. Over the last six months I spend a lot of my Freedom Fridays and late nights, building a style guide for Umbraco. A still work in progress tool, but a great opportunity for us to play around with the idea of "One Style guide to rule them all". A plug and play framework for package developers, people contributing to the core, etc. for swift development and consistent design.</p>
<p>I've come to realise just how much of Umbraco is side projects. Packages, PR's to the core and even people responding on Our is somewhere a side project.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>From sketches to 200.000 views in a week</h3>
<p>Earlier this year, I made together with a good friend, a side project called <a href="https://typeanything.io" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://typeanything.io">Type Anything</a>. A small tool that enables you to test typography for your next project. We built the project with <a href="https://vuejs.org" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://vuejs.org">Vuejs</a> and integrated it with <a href="https://typekit.com" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://typekit.com">Typekit</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com" target="_blank" title="Google Fonts">Google Fonts</a>.</p>
<p>It started out with an idea. Of course this idea come to me just as I went to bed making it impossible to sleep. I just had to get the idea out of my head and into my notebook.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img style="width: 500px; height: 375px;" src="/archive/media/2016/image.jpg?width=500&amp;height=375" alt="" rel="1455" data-id="1455"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>It took around a week to build, then rebuild the app before we launched it. We submitted it to <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/type-anything" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/type-anything">ProductHunt</a> to get some fast feedback on the product. This was an easy way for us to get the app exposed at the same time. </p>
<p>Shortly after that we got featured on all sorts of websites, email campaigns etc. Type Anything is now one of the <a href="https://medium.com/product-hunt/the-44-most-loved-products-launched-in-summer-2016-deaa36125316#.eih981yyx" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://medium.com/product-hunt/the-44-most-loved-products-launched-in-summer-2016-deaa36125316#.eih981yyx">most upvoted projects in 2016</a>.</p>
<p>A simple idea, some drawings in a notebook and 4-5 nights of coding gave me the motivation to learn new stuff and create more. <span>New ideas and new ways of approaching things comes when you just play.</span></p>
<h3>Translated gibberish</h3>
<p>What I'm trying to say with all this is: Make time for play, it's an easy win-win when it comes to dealing with burnouts, motivations blocks or if you just want to learn new stuff. </p>
<p>Keep a notebook next to your bed. So when that next idea comes up that you can't let go off, write it down, draw some mock ups and make it happen.</p>
<p><strong>I wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year</strong></p>
