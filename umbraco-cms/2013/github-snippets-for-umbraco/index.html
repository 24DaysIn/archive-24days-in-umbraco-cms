      <p class="teaser">Hello all,<br>So for today's advent calendar surprise I will be writing about how I recently built the GitHub Snippets for Umbraco 7 package and what issues or problems I came across and learnt along the way.</p>
<p class="intro">So first things first, let's get a bit familiar with the package itself.</p>
<h2>What are we building?</h2>
<p>This package allows you to point to a GitHub repository or use the default repository that comes with the package to allow you to insert Razor snippets into the Partial view or Template Editor in Umbraco. It's as simple as that.</p>
<p>Let's take a quick look of what it looks like in action:</p>

<h2>Creating the Button</h2>

  </a>
  <figcaption>Here you can see the new button we have added to the Umbraco Backoffice</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The first step of this is creating an additional button in the Umbraco backoffice called Snippets which when clicked will show us our new dialog only on the Partial View or Template Editor page/s.</p>
<p>So how do we go about creating this new button? It's simpler than you think, let's look at the code snippet and then step through it.</p>
<p> </p>

      <p class="snippet-caption">This snippet allows you to add a button to the Umbraco backoffice</p>
<p>So the snippet above will add a button to the Umbraco backoffice using the UmbracoPage Load event and check if the page URL is the template of partial view editor, if so it will add our Add Snippet button.</p>
<p>As you can see the button has some inline JavaScript that is run when it is clicked. This was the hardest part for me and involved me trawling through the Umbraco source on GitHub and asking lots of questions to lead Umbraco Belle developer Per Ploug on twitter.</p>
<p>But the most important part from the JavaScript is the <strong>UmbClientMgr.openAngularModalWindow()</strong> function that has a path to our Angular HTML file for the modal and a callback function that is invoked when the modal is posted back or a selection has been made, in our case a snippet has been selected.</p>
<p>Inside the callback you will see two further calls that took me a few hours to find, but allows me to insert the snippet into the code editor and then one to display a nice friendly notification message.</p>
<p><strong>UmbClientMgr.contentFrame().UmbEditor.Insert()</strong> is the function that allows me to inser the code snippet and the <strong>top.UmbSpeechBubble.ShowMessage()</strong> allows me to show a nice new notification. Some of these calls are legacy but allows a WebForms page like the template editor to run the new Angular Services like NotificationService by using an old function such as <strong>UmbSpeechBubble.ShowMessage()</strong>.</p>
<h2>Creating the WebAPI Controller to fetch GitHub Snippets</h2>
<p><span>So now onto the next part and look at how I built the WebAPI that the Angular Modal uses to go and fetch the snippets from the GitHub repository using GitHub's API. Lets dive straight into the Controller code and review it afterwards.</span></p>

}</code></pre>
<p>The points to take away from this code snippet is that firstly I have inherited my class from <strong>UmbracoAuthorizedApiController</strong> this allows only users logged into the Umbraco back office to make a call to this WebAPI, as we don't just want anyone to be able to fetch our GitHub Snippets publically. So inheriting from this class allows Umbraco to deal with the authentication for us.</p>
<p>With that part done the next thing to know is that I have applied an attribute <strong>[PluginController("Snippets")]</strong>. What this does allows Umbraco to detect in our DLL once this is built, that this a controller that needs to be registered and automatically routed for us. So all of my WebAPI calls can be done by going to <strong>http://site.co.uk/umbraco/snippets/methodName</strong></p>
<p>The final part to learn from this code snippet GetContent() and GetDecodedContent() call the remote GitHub API to go and fetch the remote JSON from their API. I won't go into too much detail here as hopefully the code is commented enough for you to understand what is happening. But in a nutshell you just need to know it's getting JSON from GitHub's API and returning it for us.</p>
<h2>Creating the Modal HTML View &amp; Angular Components</h2>
<figure class="pull-right">
  <a href="/archive/media/2013/snippet_dialog.png">
    <img src="/archive/media/2013/snippet_dialog.png" width="1440" alt="Here you can see the new dialog listing out GitHub snippets inside it">
  </a>
  <figcaption>Here you can see the new dialog listing out GitHub snippets inside it</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This next step involves a few components. It first includes the HTML for the modal with Angular directives such as <span class="code">ng-repeat</span> to loop through our list of Snippets from the WebAPI call we make, along with an Angular resource and controller JavaScript files and finally a JSON manifest file to get our JavaScript files picked up by the Umbraco back office.</p>
<p>Lets start off with the Angular Resource JavaScript file, as this file goes and fetches data from our WebAPI we have just created.</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>angular.module("umbraco.resources")
    .factory("snippetResource", function ($http) {
        return {
            getSnippets: function (path) {
                return $http.get("/umbraco/snippets/github/GetContent?path=" + path);
            },

            getSnippetDecoded: function (path) {
                return $http.get("/umbraco/snippets/github/GetContentDecoded?path=" + path);
            },

            getRepoUser: function () {
                return $http.get("/umbraco/snippets/github/GetRepositoryUser");
            },

            getRepoName: function () {
                return $http.get("/umbraco/snippets/github/GetRepositoryName");
            }
        };
});</code></pre>
<p>In this Angular Resource file you can see I have a few functions such as <strong>getSnippets</strong>, <strong>getSnippetDecoded</strong> which uses Angulars <strong>$http</strong> helper to fetch the remote JSON from our WebAPI we created.</p>
<p>Additionally you can see that I have given it a name of <strong>snippetResource</strong> so that it can be used in our Angular Controller file.</p>
<p>The next part of the puzzle is the Angular Controller needed to pass data to our HTML view for the modal.</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>angular.module("umbraco").controller("Snippets.GitHubController", function ($scope, snippetResource) {

    //Repository Name &amp; User
    $scope.repoUser = snippetResource.getRepoUser();
    $scope.repo     = snippetResource.getRepoName();

    //Get Snippets from Resource (API)
    snippetResource.getSnippets('/').then(function (snippets) {
        $scope.snippets = snippets;
    });

    //Insert Snippet - button click
    $scope.insertSnippet = function (selectedSnippet) {

        var selectedSnippetPath = selectedSnippet.path;

        //Get the snippet to decode from the Resource aka API
        snippetResource.getSnippetDecoded(selectedSnippetPath).then(function (snip) {

            //Create a snippet object to pass through to callback
            var snippet = {
                name: selectedSnippet.name,
                code: snip.data
            };

            //Debugging
            console.log(snippet);

            //Submit dialog - fires callback event for open dialog
            $scope.submit(snippet);
        });

    };

});
</code></pre>
<p>The first part is that we need to register our controller in the Umbraco module or app as its also known as in Angular. The controller name <strong>Snippets.GitHubController</strong> is what we will need to use in our HTML view for our modal.</p>
<p>The next part is that I am registering the <strong>snippetResource</strong> in the controller initialisation, so that I can use it in the controller to talk to our WebAPI controller to retrieve JSON. The first two lines is getting the repository name and repository user from our WebAPI via the snippetResource and defining them to properties on the <span class="code">$scope</span> so we can use them easily in our view.</p>
<p>We are using the snippetResource to then fetch all the snippets and wait until it's returned to then assign the JSON it recieves from the WebAPI to a property called snippets on the <span class="code">$scope</span>. So that we can easily loop &amp; iterate over it in our modal view.</p>
<p>The final part of this controller is to create a function called <strong>insertSnippet</strong> that takes the selected snippet JSON object and then call the API to get the decoded contents of the selected snippet from our Web API.</p>
<p>I then create a new JSON object and assign the snippet contents and the snippet name and pass that to a function called <strong>$scope.Submit()</strong> which closes the dialog and will then invoke the callback function we created for when our main insert snippet button was clicked. So this will allow the snippet JSON object to be used in the callback for it to be inserted into the code editor and the notification to be shown.</p>
<p>Next is to create our modal HTML view and wire it up to our Angular controller.</p>
<pre class="language-markup"><code>&lt;div class="umb-panel" ng-controller="Snippets.GitHubController"&gt;
    &lt;div class="umb-panel-footer"&gt;
        &lt;div class="btn-toolbar umb-btn-toolbar pull-right"&gt;
            &lt;a href class="btn btn-link" ng-click="close()"&gt;
                &lt;localize key="cancel" /&gt;
            &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class="umb-modalcolumn-header"&gt;
        &lt;div class="umb-el-wrap umb-panel-buttons"&gt;
            &lt;div class="span6"&gt;
                &lt;div class="form-search"&gt;
                    &lt;i class="icon-search"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
                    &lt;input type="text" ng-model="searchTerm" class="umb-search-field search-query" placeholder="Filter..."&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class="umb-panel-body umb-scrollable"&gt;
        &lt;div class="tab-content umb-control-group"&gt;
            &lt;div class="umb-pane"&gt;
                &lt;h4&gt;GitHub Snippets&lt;/h4&gt;
                &lt;h5&gt;{{ repoUser.data }}/{{ repo.data }}&lt;/h5&gt;

                &lt;ul class="unstyled"&gt;

                        &lt;span class="pull-left"&gt;{{ snippet.name }}&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;a href="#" class="btn btn-primary pull-right" ng-click="insertSnippet(snippet)" prevent-default&gt;
                            &lt;i class="icon icon-code"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Insert Snippet
                        &lt;/a&gt;
                    &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<p>This is the HTML for the modal view, I had to take a look at a few modals in the Umbraco source code to see what markup and CSS classes was expected for it to look like a neat modal and to fit in with the rest of the Umbraco Belle user interface.</p>
<p>The points to take away from this is that the first <span class="code">div</span> has an attribute called <strong>ng-controller</strong> with the value of <strong>Snippets.GitHubController</strong> which is the name of our controller we defined in the previous file. I won't go into too much depth &amp; detail here and this is relatively basic Angular View that is fetching &amp; displaying values from the <strong>$scope</strong> in our controller and iterating over a loop for our snippets property on the <strong>$scope</strong>.</p>
<p>You can see inside my loop of the snippets is that I have a button that has an attribute of <strong>ng-click</strong> with the value of <strong>insertSnippet(snippet)</strong> that calls our function in our controller. Which goes and fetches the content of the selected snippet via the API and then closes the dialog, inserts the snippet &amp; shows the notificiation.</p>
<p>We are almost on the home straight now, the final piece of the jigsaw puzzle is to create a <strong>package.manifest</strong> JSON file in order to register our two Javascript files into the Umbraco application.</p>
<pre class="language-markup"><code>{
        propertyEditors: [],

        javascript: [
            '~/App_Plugins/Snippets/Snippets.Github.Controller.js',
            '~/App_Plugins/Snippets/Snippet.Resource.js'
        ]
}</code></pre>
<p>The one thing to note is that our JavaScript &amp; HTML modal needs to live in Umbraco's plugin folder which is <strong>/App_Plugins</strong> in there I have created a folder called <strong>Snippets</strong> where the following files need to live:</p>
<ul>
<li>/App_Plugins/Snippets/Snippet.Resource.js</li>
<li>/App_Plugins/Snippets/Snippets.GitHub.Controller.js</li>
<li>/App_Plugins/Snippets/snippet-dialog.html</li>
<li>/App_Plugins/Snippets/package.manifest</li>
</ul>
<p>With these files in place and our code compiled into a DLL so the button in our event handler and our WebAPI we are good to go to test this out.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>So now we are all done lets take a look at the finished thing, it's a thing of beauty! Thank you for taking the time out to read this massive post but I hope you have found some useful snippets or pointers for yourself to take away and use in your own projects.</p>
<p>I hope you found today's Umbraco advent calendar was helpful and useful to you all. I look forward to seeing what all you happy Umbraco developers create with Umbraco 7</p>
<p>Well there's only one thing left to say, Happy Christmas &amp; New Year.<br>Warren x</p>
