      <p class="teaser"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s Christmas time everyone! Holiday season! Lots of time spent with loved ones, families and friends, a lot of presents and of course a good chunk of free time.<br></span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working in the tech world means that you need to be a lifetime learner but during this time of year hopefully all of us will not learn anything and just rest our busy brains!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who am I?</span></h2>
<p class="intro"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am Busra Sengul. Former high school maths teacher, now a developer for 3 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have a bachelor’s degree in mathematics then I achieved the qualifications to be a teacher. Although I loved teaching and did it for 5 years, I never wanted to be a teacher. It was a </span><strong>must</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for me to have more than one profession (You'll get why it was a ”must” later on!).<br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I always wanted to be a cryptographer, it’s still in my plans to get qualifications for it by either getting a master’s degree or learning somehow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was always interested in the internet of things. I had my own online radio channel when I was in high school. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After 5 years of teaching I got into the biggest technical university’s software development program in Turkey and completed it by being the 3rd among more than 200 people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I moved to Scotland and landed my first role as an intern and after 5 months I was offered a permanent role! I’ve loved being a developer since my first day but I kept hearing this phrase, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you love what you do you never actually work a day in your life</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we all know, love is a bittersweet concept.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early ages</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I taught myself reading and writing when I was 3 years old. From the first day I could read, I read everything. I had a huge hunger to learn already. I was a curious, noisy child back then. I can’t say much has changed! 😁</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the first grade, my teacher gave us daily written homework. My mother helped by ‘supervising’ me. I remember she either erased everything I wrote or tore the pages of my notebooks when she didn’t like my handwriting. This was our daily routine after school.<br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I can’t say I enjoyed it much! But in my mother’s defense, my handwriting was awful and now it is really good - That’s all thanks to her 😊</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was 8 years old, my mother enrolled me to take part in an English language course which was before the school curriculum even started teaching us, and at the same time, I was training for aerobics too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every summer, I went to a language course, sports training, and a musical device learning course. By the age of 14, I had my advanced level English certifications, playing guitar fairly well, playing basketball in a local team and in the school team. I also learned how to play the violin a bit, some piano, block flute, volleyball, handball, tennis, and some football too. Not that I kept up with them all, but in case I want to pick any of them up, I know the basics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During school terms, it was not different either. Different courses after school or if nothing was going on then I headed to the library to read, teaching my sisters how to read, how to solve math problems, helping with their homework, as well as private tutoring neighbors’ children for pocket money.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a student</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was a really mischievous student. The one who was always talking during the classes, making others laugh at really inappropriate times. I even had a gang, I was so "popular" among friends and teachers, but my grades were always excellent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had a 0-100 point system and I always scored above 85-90. Even as this was the case, my mother was always questioning me after I get a result from an exam; </span></p>
<p><em>“Why couldn’t you score 100?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Did you learn what was your mistake?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Who else got the same scores?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Who got 100?”<span style="font-weight: 400;">...</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">🤦‍♀️</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She knew who was good in my class and asked what their grades were too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This never really changed, even when I was at university she kept asking these same questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not because she was angry or disappointed with my scores, but because she was curious and she wanted to be sure I learned my mistakes and corrected them. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later on</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What my mother’s attitude created in me now was more of a serious problem. I used to get angry when she was asking these questions, not to her but to myself. I started to question: ‘Am I not good enough?’ ‘Am I stupid to make that silly mistake?’ </span></p>
<p><strong>To be clear I am not really blaming my mother for how she reacted to my school grades or to my issues and constant mischiefs.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I totally understand why she was asking her questions. But it doesn’t change my current situation of why I am still criticizing myself very harshly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a lot easier back then. I never took school lessons seriously to be honest because it was a set curriculum, there were a lot of books to re-learn - and I was always achieving good results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, it’s very different while working.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h2>Switching careers</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have always appreciated learning new stuff late in your life. Leo Tolstoy learnt how to ride a bike when he was 67!! When I switched careers at 28, I knew it was never too late to do so, but there were so many things to learn. It was scary, but being afraid doesn’t solve anything. I just needed to work harder to reduce the gap of knowledge between me and my peers. It’s safe to say that the gap was just growing bigger every day…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So that’s what I have set out to do since the first day I started working as a developer - Complete my job during office hours and try to learn and practice after work hours. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it ever enough?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While working on a client project, if I was stuck on something and end up spending ‘too much time’ trying to figure out what I need to do, I would then feel obligated to make up that time after work. You can always find me online till midnight on so many weekdays. I still get angry at myself when I miss a piece of code which means the project shows errors, or if I know that there’s an easier way to do things but I can’t remember the fix, even if I did the exact same thing just a few days earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When stuff like this started occurring more than once a day, I started to question myself again...</span></p>
<p><em>I’m not really qualified to do my job.</em></p>
<p><em>I’m not enough.</em></p>
<p><em>I am stupid.</em></p>
<p><em>I’m a fraud.</em></p>
<p><em>I got here with just dumb luck, they’ll see how terrible I am I’ll get fired eventually.</em></p>
<p><em>How can others do? </em></p>
<p><em>How do they maintain their lives and also be amazing at their jobs?</em></p>
<p><em>What is it that I’m doing wrong or not doing enough?</em> 🤷‍♀️</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These thoughts would then seep into everything. My relationships, my friendships, housework, whatever I did during the day, I felt I wasn’t enough but I tried to do more work to make it up. To feel I was worth enough. My sleep got more and more irregular as there were so many things to consider during the day including work, and I couldn’t stop overthinking when I eventually tried to go to sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the inability to sleep well, the lack of energy and feeling withdrawn from the job I love emotionally, I welcomed burnt-outs at first. The meltdowns followed after.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Realization</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started working with a life coach during the first lockdown of the pandemic while trying to  deal with my insecurities. That’s when I realized the reasons for the thoughts above. While working with my coach I’ve learned what </span>Imposter Syndrome<span style="font-weight: 400;"> is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The definition of imposter syndrome is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“the persistent inability to believe that one's success is deserved or has been legitimately achieved as a result of one's own efforts or skills”</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It refers to an internal experience of believing that you are not as competent as others perceive you to be. While this definition is usually narrowly applied to intelligence and achievement, it has links to perfectionism and the social context as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So there it is. I have imposter syndrome! I didn’t believe that I was good enough in anything no matter what people were saying about me. When I learned I got the Umbraco MVP award I was deeply shocked! I still don’t think I did enough to contribute to the community in order to deserve this award! Even though I keep hearing amazing things about what I have done! </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know the reasons! I'm not broken anymore(!)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding the reason why I was feeling the way I was feeling stalled me for a while. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess somehow I deceived myself that I had the solution. This new information cleared so many grey clouds from my brain. Whenever I started falling into the same thoughts I reminded myself why I was thinking them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It never prevented me from thinking those toxic thoughts but I now know the reason, I kept believing it was solved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case was closed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m fixed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if that's the case;</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why was I still having burnt-outs? </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why was I working my butt off until midnight on so many days? </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">What happened now? 👀</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Am I in depression? </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why are sleep remedies still not working? </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why am I obsessively trying to clean my flat when it’s actually really clean? </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">How could I help that friend out? I should text other 10 more friends tomorrow to just ask them how they’re doing.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">I still need to get that 3rd .Net 5 course completed, one is never enough. Duh!</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that error in my code today, let’s start thinking about the code I wrote in the morning from the beginning to find the issue. </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, I need to go shopping, but I also need to save up money! My sister’s birthday is coming up soon. </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">It'd be good to do batch cooking this weekend.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">I should clean my flat again, even though I did a big cleaning the other day.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh wait the code, I think I know what’s the problem, well I can’t sleep already I should turn my laptop on to work a bit more... </span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More screen time, less sleep time… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This became a regular occurrence at nighttime and these are a genuine snippet of examples of what’s going on inside my mind. There are also unrealistic scenarios of the conversations I might have (or had) with people. I also think about a family member's problem which I have zero control over. Future planning, massive amounts of stresses and traumas caused by previous romantic relationships, previous workplaces, family members... And on and on...</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I know what’s causing all these, so it should be fine shouldn’t it??</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">A second realization</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started reading a book called</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><a href="https://feelinggood.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feeling Good by Dr. David Burns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This book is used to help people with cognitive-behavioral issues by professional therapists. If you follow the instructions you can also be your own therapist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently I’ve read a phrase and that’s when everything came to light 💡:</span></p>
<p><strong><em>“Finding the source or nature of your problem could make you gain self-insight; but, usually this will not make you change your behavior. This is actually not surprising. For years, you’ve been feeding your insecurities with destructive thought habits. To resolve your issue, there should be a systematic and constant effort.”</em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was my issue. I have been hiding behind the reasons but never actually thought about how to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">resolve</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> my issues! And to be honest </span>there is no guide for a living,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> you know. None of the therapists or my life coach could ever show me how to fix them, but then I guess it’s never the case with them, they can never actually tell you what to do. You can only help yourself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, that’s not entirely correct.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes I can help myself, but I am a human just like everyone else around me. While there are no massive expectations from me either from my job or my friends or family, I came to the conclusion that I should be more open about my feelings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point I have to say, I am working with incredible people. I am extremely lucky to work with them. Every single one of them is such an understanding, caring person. Even when I wasn’t aware of it, when I was so close to another burn-out, my boss had forced me to take some time off. He always received my blurt-outs in a really friendly way and helped me in so many ways that I can’t even begin to start writing here. Working in a really friendly environment, amazing co-workers, genuine friends, I’m so lucky! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started talking more about my feelings to my family/friends and only received good thoughts and kind feelings. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solution</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So here I am. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First I had to deal with my imposter monster that was living inside my brain. Find out how it had been created and how I had continued to feed it and allow it to make quite a comfortable home. Finally, after letting it grow for over 30 years, I started to learn how to beat it! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following steps made me realize my problems and helped me find solutions;</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Admitting that I have a problem.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trying to be more aware of my feelings and the thoughts that are causing those feelings. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defining the problems, with therapists, life coaches, books…</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Realizing that defining the problems is not a solution.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding the solutions</span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be open and honest about how I feel to everyone around me, as long as they’re open to receive</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WRITE down the automatic thoughts that are actually behind those emotions (self-criticism) </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Realize that the emotions arise when the monster is awake and doing its job with the self-criticism</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn the </span><a href="https://positivepsychology.com/cognitive-distortions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cognitive distortion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for these thoughts (I’ve got the book for the definitions and how to realize them)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Write down more realistic and logical thoughts that are actually happening and talk and try to convince my inner self (self-defense)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Re-consider the emotions after my self-defense</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be consistent with this system - no one can change what’s been there for 30 years in a flash</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stop speaking/thinking ill about myself</span></li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p>Here’s a daily example of one of the issues that the stupid imposter monster has been causing me and how I try to defeat it:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My boss asks me to implement a new piece of functionality to an existing project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I write my code, test it, make sure it works, create a PR, and submit it for review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My boss submits feedback which includes an obvious mistake I’ve made.</span></p>
<p>Within just a split second, right after I read the feedback, the monster starts inside my mind:</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How could you possibly not see that mistake, you are so stupid! He showed you what to do ages ago, now he will think you don’t listen to him. You always make stupid mistakes. You never get better, eventually, he will give up and fire you!”</span></em></p>
<p><strong>The feelings after these thoughts:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anxious - 90%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upset - 75%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disappointed in myself - 95%</span></p>
<p><strong>Cognitive distortions in every single thought:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How could you possibly not see that mistake, you are so stupid!”</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overgeneralization,</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magnification (Catastrophizing) or Minimization </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labeling and Mislabeling</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He showed you what to do ages ago, now he will think you don’t listen to him.”</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumping to Conclusions – Mind Reading</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You always do stupid mistakes.”</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All-or-Nothing Thinking / Polarized Thinking</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overgeneralization</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mental Filter</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You never get better, eventually, he will give up and fire you!”</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All-or-Nothing Thinking / Polarized Thinking</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overgeneralization</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mental Filter</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumping to Conclusions – Fortune Telling</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magnification (Catastrophizing) or Minimization</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The next step is to write more realistic thoughts for each one of them:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How could you possibly not see that mistake, you are so stupid!”</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s normal to miss that mistake, this doesn’t mean I am stupid. It means I am human. Everyone makes mistakes.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He showed you what to do ages ago, now he will think I don’t listen to him.”</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s so common to forget what to do. Almost all of the developers keep searching how-to dos for the same thing even though they have done it repeatedly. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He knows I am listening to him. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You always make stupid mistakes.”</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an exaggeration. I don’t ALWAYS make mistakes, I sometimes make mistakes and it is decreasing every day. No one is perfect, everyone can make mistakes, this doesn’t mean they always do stupid mistakes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next time try to be more alert to these kinds of mistakes.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You never get better, eventually, he will give up and fire you!”</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am already getting better. Most of the feedback about my work is actually pretty good. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t predict if he will give up and fire me but I can prevent this from happening by working harder and that’s the only thing I can do already.</span> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The feelings after my realistic and logical thoughts:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relieved - 55%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anxious - 20%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upset - 10%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disappointed in myself - 30%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a genuine process about just one issue, and these are genuine feelings after I complete writing thoughts down. As you see it helps me a lot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, this is how I am trying to help myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a constant battle and it is really frustrating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from all these, I am trying meditation, self and beauty care and socializing more. I am also trying to take more days off so I can rest longer on some weekends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most days it’s hard to find the motivation but I think it is still good progress. I try to manage my spare time better, to have some time for myself every week and aim to break these tasks down into smaller daily chunks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are having similar issues, you are not alone. Please don't be afraid to talk about it. There's nothing more natural than struggling with trying to live with yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope my experiences and my monster have shed some light and been helpful to someone! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loads of pure love and happy Christmas!</span></p>
