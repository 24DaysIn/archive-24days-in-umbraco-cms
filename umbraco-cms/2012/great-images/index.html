      <p class="teaser">Hi everybody. My name is Niels Steinmeier, and I run a small digital company called <a href="http://vokseverk.dk" target="_blank" title="Vokseværk">Vokseværk</a> along with two awesome dudes.</p>
<p class="intro">On a daily basis I - one way or another - work with and within Umbraco. As an Editor though, since my programming skills are more or less on a non-existing level - and oh no, not meaning that in any good way ... at all - just ask around! :D</p>
<p>Anyways, since we've got that cleared you might have guessed that you're not going to see any code in this post (<em>boooo ... we're coders, we demand code!</em>). Yes yes .. I know, but just bear with me here ... you might even learn something completely different.</p>
<p><span>Images are my speciality. And images have a huge effect on how a website - or any other digital media for that matter - is presented.</span></p>

<p>We all look to Apple if we want a reference or a benchmark on how to make a great presentation. And YES! Apple have a bunch of great products - I use most of them myself - but if you really look, you'll notice that one thing all Apple presentations have, is GREAT images. Professionally shot, edited and cropped. Flawless.</p>
<h3>We should have that too!</h3>
<p>Sure we should, and that's the whole reason for this post ... with a darn long intro :D</p>
<p>When prepping a site for a client it's ok to have images of <a href="http://placekitten.com/1200/400" target="_blank">kittens</a> scattered all over the site - for <em>testing</em> purposes. But when you get to the point of presenting the site to the client, you should really use great photos that are more representative to the site.</p>
<h3>And why should you do this?</h3>
<p>You should because it's my experience, after many years of trial and error, that most clients don't respond positively to "layout" images or "lorem ipsum" texts.</p>
<p>Though you're telling them "<em>this will all be replaced, of course, with your content</em>" and they say "<em>Oh ... I see</em>". Still, they often don't get it. Furthermore, this is your chance as an angency to guide your clients on the "right path". And by that, of course, I mean YOUR path: Your ideas, your design and maybe even your images.</p>
<p><em>Let me demo that for you</em></p>
<p>We had this assignment of totally redesigning a site. It was a school, that - amongst other needs - needed to present the teachers and staff. A quick thing to fail due to often bad images, and/or different angles and crops of the people. So what we did, was using a batch of my various portraits - in different crops - and in black-and-white [<em>always a good trick, if you have very different images</em>] showing them, how we envisioned the staff presentation.</p>
<p>Like this <em>[click for larger view]:</em></p>

  </a>
  <figcaption>Our Photoshop layout presented to the client</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>(Just imagine that with kittens instead ... right?)</p>
<p>So what happed was that the client realised, that this would not do with their current - sorry to say - own <em>[read: bad</em>] images. So they hired a photographer to shoot and - ta-da - color grade the images, to get that consistent look.</p>
<p>The final result <em>[click for larger view]:</em></p>

</figure>
<p>One <strong>happy</strong> client ... but also one <strong>happy</strong> agency :)</p>
<p>A little bonus info: We got to do all the crops for the images - and yes, we're using the standard Image Cropper here. The images have no fixed spot in the grid, it all depends on the amount of staff. A new comes in, the layout of the page is rearranged. So each staff image actually have tree crops: One square, one tall and one wide. Umbraco takes care of all that for us - well, actually our mighty coda-Yoda® <a href="/twitter.com/greystate" target="_blank" title="The mighty coda-yoda®">Greystate</a> wrote some kind of algorithm for that ... but still.<br><br></p>
<h3>But I don't have any great photos I can use!</h3>
<p>Sure you do. Either the client has provided a bunch for you to use, once the design phase begun, or you may have a pile in you system. Otherwise you have have a couple of options:</p>
<ol>
<li>You could use stock-images from i.e. <a href="http://www.istockphoto.com" target="_blank" title="iStock Photo">iStock Photo</a> or <a href="http://www.shutterstock.com" target="_blank" title="Shutterstock">Shutter Stock</a></li>
<li>Or you could shoot them yourself </li>
</ol>
<p>If you go with option 1 you should more or less be home free, editing wise. The cool thing about these sites is, that images are fairly cheap. All the way down to $1 pr. image. Beware, some are fairly expensive though. But you can be sure to get quality images.</p>
<p>If you go with option 2 and you're not an image editing/color correction expert ... don't worry, I've got you all covered.</p>
<p>All you need is <strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong> or <strong>Adobe Photoshop Elements</strong>. Both apps can be downloaded and tested free for 30 days <a href="http://www.adobe.com/downloads/" target="_blank" title="Get Adobe trial versions">here</a>.</p>
<p>When you're set, simply load the action I'm providing here on the site [<em>see bottom of article</em>] and run it on you images.</p>
<p><em>What does it do?</em> - <strong>glad</strong> you asked.</p>
<p>Basically it does sort of a "general color correction", adds contrast and sharpening to your images. So let me show you a before and after.</p>
<figure>
  <a href="/archive/media/2012/before_after.jpg">
    <img src="/archive/media/2012/before_after.jpg" alt="It's not magic, but still the AFTER is MUCH better" width="810">
  </a>
  <figcaption>It's not magic, but still the AFTER is MUCH better</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The image is more clear now and colors are more vibrant. Believe me, this does make a difference.</p>
<p>And if you <em>are</em> a Photoshop expert, then <em>please</em> remember to be creative. Play with cropping and color grading. You might just get that extra order from the client.</p>
<p>And as a finishing touch, I'll show you just that.</p>
<figure>

<p>I hope you all can see the potential of this ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And finally ... the Photoshop Action - <a href="/archive/media/2012/image_enhancer.atn.zip" title="Get the Photoshop action for enhancing images">download it here</a>.<span style="color: green;"> </span></p>
<p>I hope you learned something from this and enjoyed it ... despite the lack of code lines.</p>
<p>Keep those great images flowing ... and have a wonderful Christmas.</p>
